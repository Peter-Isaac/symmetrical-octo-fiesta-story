There once was a turtle named Sheldon who lived in a pond. It was kind of a
dirty pond and Sheldon wanted to fix it up.

Then he found some tools in the nearest forest and started his plans.
Sheldon bought some Febreeze because he thought it would make the pond smell better. 

Along with the febreeze, Sheldon bought some bathroom cleaner and bleach not realizing how dangerous they were to his pond
and fellow fish.
Sheldon used some of the cleaner in the pond and immediately, his fish friend, Gary got sick.
Sheldon realized what he had done and rushed Gary to the hospital. 

Thankfully, the fish doctors were from another world and were able to save Gary in the nick of time. 
They lived happily ever after until Sheldon decides he doesn't like the smell of the pond.
